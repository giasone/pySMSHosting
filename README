Python Wrapper Library for Smshosting.it SOAP API

Features:
  Up-to-date with SMSHosting.it api.
  Actively under development.
  Supports all of the SMSHosting.it api endpoints.
  

Getting started:
  This is a Python library that works with the SMSHosting.it API. This libraries uses SOAP, thatâ€™s not necessarily good but I just thought it fit better in to Python since XML-RPC is part of the standard python library. The format that the API functions return is a nested dictionary, it might change later to something more palatable. Other features include a streamlined authentication process and an integrated upload method. Anyway, this whole library came to be because I am working on a SMSHosting.it client that I will be releasing shortly i think. Here is how it works:


Installing:  
  You may also clone/download the source code and then execute:
      python setup.py install (run as root)
  If you wish you may also bundle the pySMSHosting package with your application.
